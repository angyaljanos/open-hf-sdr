Goal Specification:
In order to avoid the possibility of overloading the next frequency mixer, and also minimalize 
sideband noise, a bandpass filter with the center frequency of 37.4 MHz was neccesary.
We wanted to minimalize passband ripple, and have a filter with the best possible phase linearity.
It was also important to not depend on rare and expensive inductors and have the smallest component
count possible.
Design Iterations:
I wanted to design a Butterworth bandpass filter, because of its low passband ripple, and phase
linearity. I went through multiple iterations, using 4th to 6th order topologies, with different
Q factors. In order to be able to buy commonly available inductors, I choosed values from the E12 series.
The most difficult issue was dealing with tolerances, because in many iterations the passband ripple 
was varying largly in the tolerance simulations.
Final design:
I was able to counter the passband ripple variance by choosing increasing the bandwidth.
