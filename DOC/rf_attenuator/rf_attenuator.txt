Specified Goal:
We wanted to design a programmable attenuator with 0dB to 30dB attenuation in 10dB steps. We had to
design it as a 50 ohm impedance matched network. 
Design Iterations:
First of all, I calculated three separate T-pad attenuator networks for the 3 attenuation values.
I was planning to cascade the three T-networks with J-FET switches enabling to bypass each pad.
This topology would have allowed the opportunity to combine attenuators and have up to 60dB attenuation.
Because of the need for DC offset to be present at the JFET's Drain and Source it was not an optimal
solution for our goal.
The second and the final iteration was designed with a 2 channel 4:1 multiplexer/demultiplexer integrated
circuit. I used the same three T-pad attenuators and used the multiplexer as two
single pole, four throw switches.

In order to reduce complexity and cost, I did not use the calculated resistance values for the T-pads,
but I choose the closest E24 value. I also disregarded the typical 4 ohm resistance of the multiplexer.
